# TreeDistance

## Zhang-Shasha tree distance algorithm

A Swift implementation of Zhang-Shasha algorithm for *ordered* tree distance calculation. Calculates a series of transformations required to transform one tree into another. Every transformation has an associated cost. The sum of costs of all transformations is minimal - the tree distance.

Based on the Java implementation:
